## 4. Hair Detail Preservation

### 4.1 Hair Detection Algorithm

**Gabor Filter Bank Approach**:
- Multiple orientations (0°-180° in 15° increments)
- Three frequency bands optimized for hair textures
- Adaptive thresholding based on local statistics

```python
def detect_hair_regions(self, image):
    responses = []
    for theta in range(0, 180, 15):
        for freq in [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]:
            kernel = cv2.getGaborKernel((21,21), 3, theta, freq, 0.5)
            response = cv2.filter2D(image, cv2.CV_32F, kernel)
            responses.append(np.abs(response))
    
    return self._combine_responses(responses)
```

### 4.2 Structure Tensor Analysis

**Purpose**: Analyzes local hair structure for better alpha estimation.

**Method**:
1. Calculate gradient structure tensor at multiple scales
2. Compute eigenvalues for anisotropy detection
3. Enhance alpha in high-structure regions
4. Preserve fine hair strand connectivity

### 4.3 Hair-Specific Alpha Refinement

**Multi-Scale Processing**:
- Fine scale (σ=1): Individual hair strands
- Medium scale (σ=2): Hair clusters
- Coarse scale (σ=4): Overall hair regions

**Enhancement Formula**:
```
α_refined = α_base + λ * structure_factor * (1 - α_base)
```
Where `λ` is the hair enhancement strength and `structure_factor` represents local hair structure confidence.

        metrics = {
            'edge_quality': self._calculate_edge_quality(image, mask),
            'boundary_smoothness': self._calculate_smoothness(mask),
            'detail_preservation': self._assess_detail_preservation(mask),
